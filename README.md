# Mod Organizer 2 - The Sims 4 Plugin

Mod Organizer 2 plugin for The Sims 4.

# Why?

Mod Organizer 2 didn't have a plugin for The Sims 4 yet, so in order to not have to use Vortex, I made this. 

# Permissions

If the developers of Mod Organizer 2, or members of the community want to use the additions / changes I made, feel free to do so. If anyone wants to add my changes to the Mod Organizer 2 project (or any such thing), I only ask that you let me know, no need to ask me for permissions. 

# Troubleshooting

In case anyone runs into issues while using this plugin, please try to fix them, as my knowledge of the Mod Organizer 2 Python plugins is rather limited.
